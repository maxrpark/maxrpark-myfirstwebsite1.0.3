## This is my first website 1.0.3

After I created myfirstwebsite1.0  I felt that all my projects kind of look the same. So I did not feel like starting anything new. Instead, I thought I will be practicing cloning a website or at least one page, My Twitter Profile Page. 

I did not think at the time I started that I was going to upload this project because it thought I was going to be a simple thing. 
But it turned out to be the biggest project I have done.

This project gave me the change to practice a lot of CSS but specially JavaScript, I use all kind of functions and methods I did not think I could use before this project.
I was so nice to realize I could use the things I have been learning and also find out how to do the things I did not know how to do yet.

## What is it about
As the tittle says, it is a clone page of my twitter account. The website as 3 different layout depending of the screen size. Most of the buttons do something and the tweets are display dynamically.
In fact, you can visit the website and read the tweets, in them I explain what I did.
